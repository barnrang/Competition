# Competition

## Timeline
- Titanic : studied scikit decision tree and pandas
- Digit : Use SVM to classify
- House's Price : Manage normal Linear Regression and RandomForest
- Dogbreed : Deep learning Convolution Neural Network, self implemented network (not going well though) on tensorflow. Implemented pretrained network (RESNET152) on pytorch following the tutorial. After 1 hour of training achieve 0.79 loss on test sample. Later will try to implement Inceptionv3 because Resnet152 is too big!
